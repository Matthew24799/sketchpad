# sketchpad
Hello this is a SketchPad/Etc-a-Sketch that i made.
super simple to use, only has 5 buttons.
by default the canvas you draw on is 16x16.
you can make a canvas as big as 100x100 if you wanted to!
A colorPicker to pick your own color.
a pencil button to draw with said color. 
a rainbow button to make your drawings a bunch of random color.
and finally a clear button to erase the board.
